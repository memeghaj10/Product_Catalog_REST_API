# Product_Catalog_REST_API


This is a simple project based on Product Catalogs, created by me while trying to study and understand about :-

1. `MongoDB` and `MongoJs`

2. `RESTful APIs`.

3. `JavaScript`.

4. `NodeJs` and `ExpressJs`.

The created app holds the potential to perform the following functions:-

1. `CRUD` operations.

2. `Update` + `Insert` the new updated app.

3. `Create` new products with any `Schema`.
